## Project Info

This project is a Python module for calculating the number of intersections between two circles in a 2D plane. It leverages the `Circle` class to represent circles and provides a function `circle_intersections` to determine the number of intersections.

### Key Features:

- Calculate the Euclidean distance (d) between the centers of two circles.
- Determine the number of intersections based on circles radii and the distance (d).

### Use Case:

This module is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze the geometric relationship between two circles. It can be applied in various fields such as computer graphics, physics simulations, and collision detection algorithms.


## Deployment

To deploy this project:


Clone:



```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RymanAK7/python-circle-intersection.git
  cd python-circle-intersection
```
Create Enviroment, Install requirements and run tests:

```bash
make all
```


## Running the Plotter

To visualize circle intersections, you can use the `plotter.py` script provided in this repository. Follow these steps:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
cd src
```
I have included illustrative examples in `plotter.py` that showcase circle intersections. To visualize these examples, run the following command:

```bash
python plotter.py
```
